**Part 1: Test Planning**
Test Strategy Document
**Objectives of Testing:**
Ensure the quality and functionality of the e-commerce website.
Detect and fix defects early in the development lifecycle.
Validate the website's performance, usability, and security.

**Scope of Testing:**
Full coverage of key features: user registration, product search, cart management, checkout process, and order management.
Cross-browser and cross-device compatibility.
Testing on various network speeds for performance validation.

**Testing Levels:**
*Unit Testing
*Integration Testing
*System Testing
*Acceptance Testing

**Testing Types:**
1.Functional Testing
2.Usability Testing
3.Performance Testing
4.Security Testing

**Entry and Exit Criteria:**
Entry Criteria: Code is ready for testing, required environments are set up.
Exit Criteria: All high and medium priority defects are fixed, and acceptance criteria are met.

**Test Environment and Tools:**
**Environment:** Multiple environments (development, staging, production) mirroring actual usage scenarios.
**Tools:** Selenium for automated testing, Jira for test management, Jenkins for continuous integration.

**Risk Analysis:**
Identified Risks: Integration issues, third-party service dependencies, performance bottlenecks.
**Mitigation:** Regular communication, continuous monitoring, and load testing.

Test summary and final report structure.

**Part 2: Test Case Design**
* Functional Test Cases
**User Registration:**
Verify successful user registration with valid information.
Validate error messages for invalid input during registration.
Test the email confirmation process.

**Product Search:**
Search for a product by name and verify the results.
Test advanced search options (filters, sorting).
Validate the search functionality with special characters.

**Cart Management:**
Add a product to the cart and verify the cart's updated status.
Remove items from the cart and confirm the update.
Test the functionality when the cart is empty.

**Checkout Process:**
Complete a successful checkout with valid payment details.
Test error handling during the checkout process.
Verify order confirmation after successful checkout.

**Order Management:**
Access and view order history.
Test order tracking functionality.
Validate order cancellation process.

**Edge and Boundary Test Cases:**
Test scenarios with minimum and maximum values for input fields.
Validate system behavior with an empty cart during checkout.
Test extreme values for product prices.

**Part 3: Test Automation**
Test Automation Framework
**Framework:** Selenium WebDriver with TestNG.
**Reasoning:** Selenium is widely adopted, supports various programming languages, and has a strong community. TestNG provides parallel test execution and comprehensive test reporting.
Automated Test Scripts

**User Registration:**
**Positive Scenario:** Register a new user with valid details.
****Negative Scenario:** Attempt registration with invalid data.

**Product Search:**
Positive Scenario: Search for a product and validate the results.
Negative Scenario: Search with incorrect details and verify error messages.

**Cart Management:**
**Positive Scenario:** Add and remove items from the cart.
**Negative Scenario:** Attempt to perform actions on an empty cart.

**Test Data Management**
Utilize data providers in TestNG for managing test data.
Externalize test data into separate files for easy maintenance.
