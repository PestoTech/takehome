Microservices-based E-commerce System
Introduction
This project implements a microservices-based system for a simple e-commerce application. The system includes services for user authentication, product management, and order processing. Key features include concurrency control, clustering for high availability, and database integration.

Microservices Architecture
Services:
User Authentication Service

Manages user registration, login, and authentication.
Technology Stack: Spring Boot (Java)
Product Management Service

Handles CRUD operations for products.
Concurrency Control: Implemented optimistic locking.
Technology Stack: Spring Boot (Java)
Order Processing Service

Manages order creation, retrieval, and updates.
Technology Stack: Spring Boot (Java)
Concurrency Control
Optimistic Locking:
Implemented in the Product Management Service.
Ensures safe read and update of product information without conflicts.
Clustering and High Availability
Technology Used: Docker Swarm
Docker Swarm employed for clustering microservices.
Demonstrated high availability by deploying on multiple nodes.
Database Integration
Database Used: PostgreSQL
Stores user information, product data, and order history.
Database Schema: Designed for entities - users, products, orders.
APIs and Communication
RESTful APIs:
Endpoints for user registration, product CRUD, and order management.
Synchronous and asynchronous communication supported.
Authentication and Authorization
JWT Tokens:
User authentication and authorization implemented.
Users can only access their own orders and authorized product information.
General Requirements
Code Quality:

Clean, well-documented, and maintainable code.
Follows Spring Boot best practices.
Version Control:

Git used for version control.
Link to GitHub Repository
Error Handling:

Comprehensive error handling and logging in microservices.
Testing:

Unit tests for critical components and concurrency control mechanisms.
Deployment:

Instructions provided for deploying and running microservices locally or on a cloud platform.
Bonus Features (Optional)
API Rate Limiting:

Implemented to prevent abuse and ensure fair API usage.
Message Queues:

RabbitMQ used for asynchronous communication between microservices.
Caching Strategies:

Implemented caching to improve system performance.
Monitoring and Alerting:

Prometheus and Grafana set up for monitoring and alerting.
Assumptions
Assumed a reliable network environment for synchronous communication.
Assumed a containerized deployment environment with Docker installed.
Assessment Criteria
Your assignment will be evaluated based on:

Microservices Architecture: Properly structured and divided by functionality.

Concurrency Control: Effective control and maintenance of data integrity.

Clustering: Demonstrated high availability and clustering capabilities.

Code Quality: Clean, well-documented, and maintainable code.

Testing: Unit tests for critical components and concurrency control mechanisms.

Bonus Features: If implemented, they should enhance system functionality and performance.

Good luck with the assessment! If you have any questions, feel free to include them in the project documentation (backend.md).
